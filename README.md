# New_portfolio

This is my new portfolio. I designed it with HTML & CSS.

I am a frontend developer and a clinical physiologist with a proven ability to adapt in both self-starting and collaborative
environments while staying focused on achieving high-quality results under strict deadlines.

My skills and interests range from Web Design to programming, designing websites, conducting echocardiography
tests and developing software. I also have experience in project management, planning, and team building. An
opportunity to work in a diverse environment that will allow me to grow both professionally and personally is very
much welcome. Please feel free to connect if you think we could be a match.
